![seat layout sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24667361/43626651-787094d2-9710-11e8-97c2-0ceb4db5b719.gif)

To create the layout dynamically we need to pass specific syntax in string so the method could understand and process it. 

```java
String seats =        "_UUUUUUAAAAARRRR_/"
                    + "_________________/"
                    + "UU__AAAARRRRR__RR/"
                    + "UU__UUUAAAAAA__AA/"
                    + "AA__AAAAAAAAA__AA/"
                    + "AA__AARUUUURR__AA/"
                    + "UU__UUUA_RRRR__AA/"
                    + "AA__AAAA_RRAA__UU/"
                    + "AA__AARR_UUUU__RR/"
                    + "AA__UUAA_UURR__RR/"
                    + "_________________/"
                    + "UU_AAAAAAAUUUU_RR/"
                    + "RR_AAAAAAAAAAA_AA/"
                    + "AA_UUAAAAAUUUU_AA/"
                    + "AA_AAAAAAUUUUU_AA/"
                    + "_________________/";
```
As for this sample we have 3 status for the seats :<br />
* U is for already booked seats<br />
* R is for reserved seats<br />
* A is for available seats<br />

* _ is for empty space<br />

You can customize this string according to your seats arrangement. As of this string it has 175 seats each having unique id assigned to it. The assigned id is useful for sending the booked seats request to server. 

**Reserved seats VS Booked seats**<br />
Both can't be booked but showing them with seperates colors cause the reserved seats can be available with time.

**Limitation**<br />
It's not recycling the views.
